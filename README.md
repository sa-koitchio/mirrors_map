# mirrors_map
A short test map (basically only a box) for Mirrors Edge 2008

Created with some binary files from other UE3 games.

If you want to do this yourself, get some bin files and ME,
put the 2 folders into your binary folder in MEs folder,
go to steam, select ME, startup options, type editor. 
This will basically allow you to mod the game's maps to your hearts content.
